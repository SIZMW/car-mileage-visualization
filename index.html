          Car Mileage Visualization
        </h1>
        <p>
          This set of visualizations have been created for the purpose of viewing and analyzing mileage, trip, gas prices, and fuel usage trends across mileage data. I hope to use these visualizations to analyze driving habits across the year, or find instances where driving and fuel efficiency could be improved.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data for the visualization was collected from the vehicle's onboard computer, as well as when filling up the fuel tank. I plan to continue collecting data and adding it to the visualizations to see trends as time progress in the future.

          Dataset
        </h3>
        <p>
          For reference, the car used for this data is a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cars.com/research/honda-accord/specs/usc40hoc011d0/">2014 Honda Accord EX-L</a>. I mostly use the car for commuting to and from school, but less frequently for various events, travel, groceries, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          I realize that these other use cases are not made clear in the usage data, but can still make a negative impact in terms of understanding why certain trends exist. I hope to resolve this in the future with either data filtering or additional visualization(s).
